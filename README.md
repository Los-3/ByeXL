# ByeXL
Say goodbye to IXL. With this repository, i will create an extension (that can also be loaded in as a bookmarklet) that can be used to easily complete IXL assignments.

# How would it work?
ByeXL will be an extension that gathers data from every single IXL question that is done with it. When a question is answered correctly, the answer is stored into a database for the next person who gets that question. When someone gets a question that is in the database, ByeXL will automatically answer the question for you.

# This is still a concept. Feedback is appreciated.

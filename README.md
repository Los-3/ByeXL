# AIXL
With the popularity of AI recently, i thought iit may be a good idea to switch  ByeXL to AIXL in order to make it easier for everyone involved. This way, this can be completed much faster.

# How would it work?
AIXL will be an extension that finds the question you are on, and sent it into OpenAI's GPT model, and the response is shown to you, at the click of a button. This will work for literacy questions. For math questions, we may use the Symbolab API. (This may not work for graphing questions.) With a language model for lliteracy and a math solver for math questions, you will not have to deal with those stupid IXL assignments ever again.

# This is still a concept. Feedback is appreciated.

# AIExcel
With the popularity of AI recently, i thought it may be a good idea to switch  ByeXL to AIExcel in order to make it easier for everyone involved. This way, this can be completed much faster.

# How would it work?
AIExcel will be an extension that finds the question you are on, and sent it into OpenAI's GPT model, and the response is shown to you, at the click of a button. This will work for literacy questions. For math questions, we may use the Symbolab API. (This may not work for graphing questions.) With a language model for literacy and a math solver for math questions, you will not have to deal with certain assignments on a certain 3 letter website ever again.

# This is still a concept. Feedback is appreciated.

# Disclaimer!
Neither IXL nor OpenAI Endorses me for creating this. I was not told by anyone to make this; i simply don't like IXL and wanted to find a way to avoid it while helping others do so. I'm not sure if this disclaimer is legally binding, so please cut me some slack.
